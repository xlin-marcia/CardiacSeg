# Research on method for reducing occupancy

## Occupancy Rate

- Definition of Occupancy rate:

    proportion of the unique or distinct entries that are currently active or used in the memory bank

- How to measure:

    $\frac{Number\,of\, active\, memory\, entries}{Total \, memory \, capacity}$

- Be careful of what we are optimizing, it might be either storage or occupancy rate.-> follow definition
